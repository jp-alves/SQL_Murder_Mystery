# 🔍 SQL Murder Mystery Investigation

Welcome to my SQL Murder Mystery project! This interactive investigation demonstrates my SQL skills through solving a complex murder case using database queries.

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Case

A murder has occurred in SQL City on January 15, 2018, and it's up to us to solve it! Using a combination of Python, pandas, and SQLite3, we'll navigate through multiple database tables to find the killer and uncover a deeper conspiracy.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- SQLite3
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE)
- Table JOINs
- Aggregation functions
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Complex nested queries
- Data filtering and sorting
- Pattern matching with LIKE

## 🗃️ Database Structure

The investigation involves querying multiple tables:
- crime_scene_report
- person
- drivers_license
- get_fit_now_member
- get_fit_now_check_in
- facebook_event_checkin
- interview

## 🔎 Investigation Highlights

1. **Initial Crime Scene Analysis**: Started by querying the crime scene report to gather initial clues
2. **Witness Identification**: Used address information to locate key witnesses
3. **Suspect Tracking**: Cross-referenced gym memberships, check-in records, and vehicle information
4. **Final Breakthrough**: Uncovered the true mastermind through concert attendance records

## 🎯 Project Outcomes

- Successfully identified both the murderer and the mastermind behind the crime
- Demonstrated practical application of SQL
- Showcased data analysis and problem-solving skills
- Applied multiple SQL concepts in a coherent investigation
